# Scaffolding
* Add `index.html` with HTML structure
* Add `styles` folder
* Add `reset` and `main` stylesheets and link them to `index.html`

# Planning
* Determine sections of the page
![Youtube layout](youtube_layout.png)
* Add those sections to the HTML
  * Use classes for each element. This keeps our CSS separate from our markup (HTML). We can make changes to the HTML later, and as long as we use the same class names we won't have to make changes to the CSS (e.g. if we need to change the `main` tag to a `div` or `section`)

# Layout
* Add temporary background colors to your elements so you can see what the default layout is
* Use grid to make the sections fill the correct spaces
